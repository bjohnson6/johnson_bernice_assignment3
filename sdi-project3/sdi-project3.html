<p>The theme I chose for this week is about spending the summers at my grammys house as a child. Remembering all the fun things we did. Selling kool aid to the truck drivers in the backyard, the icecream truck and her freezer in the sunroom filled with tastykakes and enjoying a creme soda from the pantry. It makes me smile thinking about all the good times. My grammy just celebrated her 90th birthday this year! </p>
